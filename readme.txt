Wow, i dont know how long this will take to finish, but i'm willing to do my best to show to the broadest public possible what assembly and slow clock speeds means. Also, i miss 0x10c

If you think i am talking about minecraft in any way, shut up and read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War

on this repo you can find the source code but not the ressources, such as fonts, images, clips and sounds.
It is built with SDL2.0.1, SDL_image 2.0.0 and SDL_ttf 2.0.12.



Thanks D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney
